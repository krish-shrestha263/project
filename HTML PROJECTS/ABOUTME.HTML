                About me: I'm a passionate individual who loves exploring new ideas, creating content, and sharing my thoughts with the world. 
                Whether it's music, movies, or life itself, I enjoy diving deep into what makes things special. Im also a student :) <br><br>
I'm moving differently. This stuff ain't nothing to me, man, I'm a champ. I'm tickling the bath bubbles with my nose, we're sipping smoothies. Sipping that Strawberry Delight, sunshine citrus, Funburger supreme, Lucky Pennies scratch-off, cloud, berry bliss. We're sipping sparkling cider. I'm on twelve Jolly Ranchers sucking on a lollipop. We're sipping rainbow sherbet dreams. We're munching on that good old-fashioned goodness, toffee, jelly beans. They must have amnesia, they forgot that I'm the one. That Cozy Cabin blanket is so warm. That giggle fit sounds like a purring kitten. We're sipping juice in a paper cup, blowing sunshine bubbles. I'm silly in the head, I'm on them Happyville Gummies. I'm on them Giggle Gulch Grahams. I'm on them Snuggleton Snickerdoodles. I left my fuzzy slippers in the minivan. I'll have to show off on them next time. I don't care if I go blind. I don't need to see the price tag anyways. I'm high on twelve Fruit Snacks, looking to build a magnificent sandcastle. We're eating frosted flakes, you silly goose. I'll give you a playful noogie. Call that clubhouse The Treehouse because I'm in this place and I can't get out. Last kid who ran off with the crayons got tickled by some fuzzy mittens. The last thing he ever saw was the smiley face sticker on them. Slowly faded into giggles and I let the friendly squirrels take him. I need more rainbow sherbet dreams. Don't be shy, friend, I love me some peanut butter fluff. I'm moving like a playful puppy, "Woof?" Welcome to the fun kingdom, pal, open up a treasure chest, I'd share my candy with all my pals. My buddy's a goofball, he looks like a cartoon character. You ain't seen ten pennies in your life, kiddo. Reach for my hand, you'll get turned into a friend. Y'all gotta stop playing with me, man. I threw confetti at the birthday party under the bouncy castle. I pushed the toy car through the loop-de-loop. This stuff ain't nothing to me, man. Tied the toys to the back of a wagon and pulled 'em around the yard for 24-minutes. Playmate looked like a rag doll after we were done playing with him. Pals wanted some fun, blew up their entire pillow fort. I'm moving like a rocket. She jumped on me from a silly angle, they thought I was a superhero. Top shelf giggles disrupted my naptime. I have seen the storybook, I've seen the shiny penny. I was trading stickers for seashells before y'all even learned to ride a bike. This stuff ain't nothing to me, you silly goose. Step the wrong way and you will stumble. That hug feels like warm cocoa. You think I care about this stuff? Ask me if I care about this stuff, 'cause I don't care about this stuff. If I had a penny for every time they said I cared about this stuff, I'd be broke 'cause I don't care about this stuff. My friend looks like a movie star. I played so hard they thought I was a bouncy ball. This stuff ain't nothing to me, man. I'll give you a friendly high-five, you silly goose.
